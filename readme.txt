Mountee allows access to WordPress (and other CMS) templates as Mac Finder files, so you can work efficiently in your favorite coding app.

== Description ==

= Use Your Favourite Tools =
Everyone has their favorite Mac apps, so why be limited to creating templates inside the WordPress browser window? Mountee allows you to access your templates as Finder files, so you can work uninterrupted in your favourite app. 


= Work With Files & Folders =
Creating a new template or template group is as easy as creating a new file or folder. Develop your own set of re-usable templates and groups, then simply drag them into your Mountee drive to kick-start your next project.


= Don't Let The Control Panel Disrupt Your Workflow =
With Mountee's File Preferences panel you can control template attributes – like caching and PHP processing – directly from your editor app of choice.


= Mountee Works Behind The Scenes =
Mountee knows WordPress and ExpressionEngine. When you save a template, Mountee will clear the cache and save a revision if necessary. If you drag a template from one site to another, settings transfer over seamlessly. 


Mountee’s home on the web is at [http://hellomountee.com/](http://hellomountee.com/).

= Requirements =
Mountee works with WordPress 4.4 and higher.


Mountee is really two pieces of software: the Mac application, and the WordPress plugin. 
The plugin requires PHP 4.4.9 or later. To use the application, you’ll need Mac OS X 10.8 or higher.

= Installation =
1. Download Mountee.zip and unzip it.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
5. Install the Mac OS X App by moving the app to your Applications folder

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get documentation or support for Mountee? =
Documentation, updates, and support information can be found on the [Mountee Web site](http://hellomountee.com/).
